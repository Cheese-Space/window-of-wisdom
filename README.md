# Simple Tkinter Program to Display Fortune

This is a simple program that displays the output of the `fortune` command in a Tkinter window.

## Requirements

This program requires both `cowsay` and `fortune` to be installed. Currently, Windows is not supported because this program relies on `cowsay` and `fortune`, which are typically available on Unix-based systems.

To install `fortune` and `cowsay`, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install cowsay fortune-mod
